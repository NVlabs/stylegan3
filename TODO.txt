IMAGE GENERATION & IMAGE STORING:
	- Study if using LMDB or other type of database is a good idea
	- Study if using Discriminator to discard "bad" images is necessary

IMAGE PROJECTION:
	x Use projector/optimizer from PDillis/stylegan3-fun -> works
	x Use encoder from yuval-alaluf/stylegan3-editing -> works
	x Try to optimize the resultant latent vector of the image encoding -> works, but has bad results

LABEL EXTRACTION:
	- Use age classifier into N brackets || Use age predictor to label the ages linearly
	- Binary class (Sex)
	- Study best way to store labels

DIRECTION EXTRACTION:
	- Use SVM (ovo) for binary attributes (Sex)
	- Use SVM (ovr) for multiclass attributes (Age, skin tone, ...)
	- Use linear regression for continuous attributes (Age)

IMAGE EDITOR:
	- Design and implement GUI
